    <string name="text2">This application gives an abstract view of the inside of building including the locations of rooms, and other things in the building.
        Please keep in mind that it is not a navigation application.  It makes a bunch of different reactions when a person touches an obstacle in the map, depending on the type of obstacle.
        The appropiate reactions for every obstacle are listed below. To trigger a reaction you should double tap an appropriate button and keep pressing on it.</string>

    <string name="pop_up2">Please make sure you understand the way of using this application before the start. Do you want to have a look on short information?</string>
